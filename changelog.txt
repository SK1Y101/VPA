0.2.05: -The "Fixing the huge bugs we somehow didn't notice while we built the foundations for even more bugs later" update.
minver:0.2.05
maxver:0.2.05
required:N/A
Began work into cross platform useage modifications, specifically linux systems, begining with the updater. (I wanted to use LOaBIS on my Pi3B, okay?)
fixed some functional conflicts which dissallowed edditing and creation of new Loabii on the updater (when using the edit and add functions)
added the ability to install a new LOaBIS version from the internet to a new directory using the updater. A somewhat simple installer, if you will.
(psst, maybe eventually I'll get around to making that installer thingy)
Began work on an "after install" functionality in the updater, allowing a module to run a function once it has been installed (for setup purposes or help)
Maybe I did some more work on the module wizard... Not (deliberately) being coy, I just can't remember.
started adding the ability to search for functions, though this is currently unuseable.

0.2.04:
minver:0.2.04
maxver:0.2.04
required:N/A
Tada, we've included a very alpha module wizard now!
While not exactly in-depth, it's functionality is evolving: currently it will setup directories and correct file structure and allow basic edditing
perfect for a startup wizard and the more experianced. (Don't worry, we're working overtime adding features, this was a functional prerelease for testing purpose)
some quality of life things and minor bug fixes in the updater.

0.2.03:
minver:0.2.03
maxver:0.2.03
required:N/A
fixed a problem with the installer where downloaded modules would be corrupt or in the wrong format.
fixed a problem with the installer where some modules could not be udated/uninstalled.
fixed a problem where LOaBIS could not fetch the installer pip modules in newer systems.
fixed some syntactical errors missed in LOaBIS.
Made the persistent code work. Finally.
filled out a little more functionality on the installer.
Maybe we did some optimisation on the installer. maybe.                                                                                                                                        (We didn't really)
Started work on the module creation wizard, look out for that in the upcoming updates (I'm predicting 0.2.04 for that, this was mostly a bug fixing update).

0.2.02: -The "lets finally revisit some of the older code because it's terrible"
minver:0.2.02
maxver:0.2.02
required:N/A
Started work on the persistent code functionality.
some light development on a user interface for the VPA, see the basicui module for a very unoptimised look at the possibilites.
some more code clean up.
took a look at re-adding cross module variables. (I had completely forgotten to add them back in 0.2.00).
Did a lot of documentation in the scripts, making some of them easier to read and giving the functions descriptor text.
Complete rewrite and overhaul from (scratch) of the Updater Program, and everything it was interacting with.
Started moving important files over to a new LOaBIS Working directory!
(Loa now has an icon too, look at us!)

0.2.01:
minver:0.2.01
maxver:0.2.01
required:N/A
Modified the updater script such that it would still work with the older file heirarchy and layout.
slight modifications to the inbuilt printing, logging, and command execution functions.
Fixed module.replacefunction such that it now works. (previosuly there was an attribute error, however a new method has been utilised to great effect)
some attempts at optimisation.

0.2.00: -The "let's rewrite the whole codebase before we miss the opportunity to do so" Update-
minver:0.2.00
maxver:0.2.00
required:N/A
Rewrote the entire program from scratch, should make it easier to debug and optimise, as well as for greater ease in the development of UI modules (see startup code and functional replacement for more details)
added in new persistant timed code, where functions can be executed automatically at regular intervals.
*note, the persistent code has not currently been enabled, and has been ommited from this version to halt the introduction of more pottential unnesecary bugs.
added in new startup code, where modules can execute functions at the initialisation of the program.
Rewrote how to make a module with the newest version, checking still required.
Probably introduced a metric F*ck ton of new bugs, we'll soon see.
Removed the ability to overwrite functions, this will be re-added in an upcoming update for the newest version.
Removed the unneccesary _core/settings module
Removed the creation of global variables across the whole script (this will also be re-added in future)
slightly modified the Updater.py script, such that it will work with the new version (This will also be re-written at a later date)
Not much else, rewriting everything took a while. (as though the largest update log is "Not much")
Added in a lot more attempts at humour and witiness in the patch notes. Not quite sure it's a good idea.
